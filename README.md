## Hello!👋
<p>I am currently pursuing a degree in Human Systems Engineering with a concentration in User Experience, and I am on track to graduate in December 2025. I have an extensive background in customer service and Retail Management, which has provided me with great insights into customer behavior and problem-solving These skills have been instrumental in my transition to User Experience design, a field I began exploring by enrolling in a bootcamp.</p>

<p>I want to focus on creating user experiences that are both inclusive and accessible, drawing from my background in customer service to really understand people’s needs. I’m new to coding, but I’ve discovered that I really enjoy it and want to keep learning so I can better complement my knowledge in user experience and research</p>

<ul>
 <li>✈️ I love traveling, which always inspires new ideas</li>
 <li>🏋️ I enjoy going to the gym</li>
 <li>🎭 Musical theatre fan</li>
</ul>
